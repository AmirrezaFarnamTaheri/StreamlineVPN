Welcome to the VPN Subscription Merger! This project provides a powerful Python script that automatically fetches VPN configurations from over 470 public sources, tests their connectivity, and merges them into a single, performance-sorted subscription link for use in your favorite VPN client. It can even save incremental batches while running so you always have up-to-date results.

This guide is designed for **everyone**, from absolute beginners with no coding experience to advanced users who want full automation.

### ⚡ Quick Start

1. Install **Python 3.8+** and clone this repository.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project folder.
3. Execute `python vpn_merger.py` and wait for the `output` directory.
4. *(Optional)* pass extra flags like `--max-ping 200` or `--concurrent-limit 10` to suit your connection.
5. Import the `output/vpn_subscription_base64.txt` link into your VPN app.

## ✨ Key Features & Use Cases

| Feature | Description | Typical Use Case |
| ------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| **Huge Source List** | Over 470 public subscription sources are built in. | Get a massive selection of servers with a single command. |
| **Availability Testing** | Checks each source before downloading. | Skip dead links and save time. |
| **Connectivity Testing** | Optional TCP checks measure real latency. | Prioritize servers that actually respond. |
| **Smart Sorting** | Orders the final list by reachability and speed. | Quickly pick the best server in your VPN client. |
| **Batch Saving** | Periodically saves intermediate results with `--batch-size` or `--reachable-batch-size`. | Useful on unreliable connections. |
| **Protocol Filtering** | Use `--include-protocols` or `--exclude-protocols` to filter by protocol. | Keep only VLESS servers or drop Shadowsocks, etc. |
| **TLS Fragment / Top N** | Use `--tls-fragment` or `--top-n` to trim the output. | Obscure SNI or keep only the fastest N entries. |
| **Resume from File** | `--resume` loads a previous raw/base64 output before fetching. | Continue a crashed run without starting over. |
| **Custom Output Dir** | Use `--output-dir` to choose where files are saved. | Organize results anywhere you like. |
| **Set Test Timeout** | Tune connection checks with `--test-timeout`. | Useful for slow or distant servers. |
| **Disable Features** | Flags `--no-url-test` and `--no-sort` give full control. | Run fast tests or skip sorting when not needed. |
| **Max Ping Filter** | Remove configs with latency above `--max-ping` ms. | Keep only fast servers for gaming or streaming. |
| **Concurrent Limit / Retries** | Tweak network load with `--concurrent-limit` and `--max-retries`. | Prevent crashes on slow networks or strict hosts. |
| **Logging to File** | Save all output to a file with `--log-file`. | Useful for headless servers or debugging. |

### 🔍 Feature Breakdown

**Huge Source List**

> Built-in links cover hundreds of GitHub projects, Telegram channels and personal blogs. Instead of hunting for URLs yourself, you get a curated list that is updated regularly. Perfect when you need a one-click way to access lots of servers.

**Availability Testing**

> Before any downloads happen, the script checks every URL to see if it is still alive. Dead links are skipped so you don't waste time waiting on missing content.

**Connectivity Testing**

> Optionally, the script opens a real TCP connection to each server and measures the latency. This ensures the final list contains servers that actually respond and are fast enough for browsing or streaming.

**Smart Sorting**

> Configurations are sorted with reachable and low-latency servers first. Your VPN client will show the best options at the top so you can connect quickly.

**Batch Saving**

> With `--batch-size` or `--reachable-batch-size` you can periodically save progress. Useful on unstable networks; if the run stops, resume with `--resume` and only new servers will be fetched.

**Protocol Filtering**

> Use `--include-protocols` or `--exclude-protocols` to keep only certain technologies (e.g. just Reality) or remove unwanted ones (like Shadowsocks). Combine with `--tls-fragment` or `--top-n` for even finer control.

**Resume from File**

> If the process is interrupted, run again with `--resume path/to/old_output.txt` and previous results will be loaded before new sources are scanned.

**Custom Output Dir / Test Timeout / Disable Features**

> Tailor where files are saved, how long connection tests run and whether optional steps run at all. These switches allow the script to fit many different environments, from low-power devices to cloud servers.

**Max Ping Filter**

> With `--max-ping` you can drop any server that responds slower than a certain number of milliseconds. Perfect for gaming or streaming when only low latency will do.

**Concurrent Limit / Retries**

> The `--concurrent-limit` and `--max-retries` options control how many requests run in parallel and how many times each download is retried. Lower the numbers on unstable networks to avoid crashes.

**Logging to File**

> Use `--log-file myrun.log` to save all console output to a file for later review. Helpful when running the script unattended on a server.

## 🧠 How It Works

The script automates a simple but powerful process to create the best possible subscription link from public sources:

1.  **📰 Gathers Sources**: It starts with a massive, built-in list of over 470 links where VPN configurations are publicly shared.
2.  **✅ Tests Source Availability**: It quickly checks each of the 470+ links to see which ones are currently online and accessible.
3.  **📥 Fetches All Configs**: It visits every active link and downloads all the individual VPN server configurations (`vless://`, `vmess://`, etc.).
4.  **⚡ Tests Server Performance**: This is the key step. It attempts a direct connection to each individual server to measure its real-world connection speed (latency/ping). Servers that are offline or too slow are discarded.
5.  **🧹 Cleans and Sorts**: Finally, it removes any duplicate servers and sorts the remaining, working servers from **fastest to slowest**.
6.  **📦 Generates Outputs**: It saves this final, sorted list into multiple formats, including the `base64` subscription file that you use in your app.
7.  **📁 Optional Batch Saving**: With `--batch-size` or `--reachable-batch-size`, the script periodically saves intermediate results while it runs.

## 🛠️ How to Get Your Subscription Link (Choose One Method)

### Method 1: Fully Automated with GitHub Actions (Recommended)

This is the best method. You will create a personal copy (a "fork") of this repository, and GitHub's servers will automatically run the script for you every 6 hours. This gives you a personal, auto-updating subscription link.

**Step 1: Fork the Repository**

1.  Make sure you are logged into your GitHub account.
2.  Go to the top of this repository's page.
3.  Click the **`Fork`** button. A "fork" is simply your own personal copy of a project.
4.  On the "Create a new fork" page, you can leave all the settings as they are and just click the green **`Create fork`** button.

**Step 2: Enable Workflows in Your Fork**

1.  After forking, you will be on the main page of *your* new repository. Click on the **`Actions`** tab.
2.  GitHub disables workflows on forks by default for security. You will see a yellow banner. Click the green button that says **`I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them`**.

**Step 3: Run the Workflow for the First Time**

1.  In the left sidebar, click on the workflow named **`Merge VPN Subscriptions`**.
2.  You will see a blue banner that says "This workflow has a `workflow_dispatch` event trigger." Look to the right side of the screen and click the **`Run workflow`** dropdown button.
3.  Leave the settings as they are and click the final green **`Run workflow`** button.
4.  The script will now start running on GitHub's servers. Wait about 3-5 minutes for it to complete. You can click on the run to see its progress.

**Step 4: Get Your Personal, Permanent Subscription Link**

1.  Once the workflow is complete (it will have a green checkmark ✓), go back to the main page of your repository (the **`< > Code`** tab).
2.  You will now see a new `output` folder. Click on it.
3.  Click on the file named `vpn_subscription_base64.txt`.
4.  On the file view page, click the **`Raw`** button.
5.  **This is your link\!** The URL in your browser's address bar is your permanent, auto-updating subscription link. Copy it. It will look like this:
    `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOUR_USERNAME/CleanConfigs-SubMerger/main/output/vpn_subscription_base64.txt`

You are now ready to use this link in any VPN app\!

### Method 2: On Your Local Computer

Use this method if you want to run the script on your own machine.

**Step 1: Install Python**
If you don't have it, download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

> **Important**: On Windows, check the box that says "**Add Python to PATH**" during installation.

**Step 2: Download the Project**

1.  Click the green **`< > Code`** button on this page -\> **`Download ZIP`**.
2.  Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your computer.

**Step 3: Install Dependencies**

1.  Open a terminal (or `cmd` on Windows).
2.  Navigate to the project folder: `cd path/to/your/folder`.
3.  Run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
      * *Troubleshooting*: If you get a "permission denied" error, try `sudo pip install -r requirements.txt` on macOS/Linux, or right-click `cmd` and "Run as administrator" on Windows.

**Step 4: Run the Script**
In the same terminal, run:

```bash
python vpn_merger.py
```

After 5-15 minutes, the `output` folder will appear with your files. To use the output, you'll need to upload the content of `vpn_subscription_base64.txt` somewhere (like a private [GitHub Gist](https://gist.github.com/)) and use that file's "Raw" URL.

### Method 3: Using Google Colab (Easy, No Setup)

1.  Go to [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com) and click **`File`** -\> **`New notebook`**.
2.  Copy the entire code from the `vpn_merger.py` file in this repository.
3.  Paste it into the Colab cell and click the "Play" button (▶️).
4.  When it finishes, find the `output` folder in the file explorer on the left. Right-click the files to download them. (Like Method 2, you'll need to host the `base64.txt` file's content to get a usable link).

## 📂 Understanding the Output Files

| File Name                              | Purpose                                                                                                  |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `vpn_subscription_base64.txt` | A base64-encoded file. Most apps import directly from this file's raw URL.                               |
| `vpn_subscription_raw.txt`    | A plain text list of all the VPN configuration links.                                                    |
| `vpn_detailed.csv`            | A spreadsheet with detailed info about each server, including protocol, host, and ping time.             |
| `vpn_report.json`             | A detailed report with all stats and configurations in a developer-friendly format.                      |

## ⚙️ Advanced Usage & Troubleshooting

#### **Command-Line Arguments**

Run `python vpn_merger.py --help` to see all options. Important flags include:

  * `--batch-size N` - save intermediate files every `N` configs.
  * `--reachable-batch-size N` - save intermediate files every `N` reachable configs.
  * `--threshold N` - stop once `N` unique configs are collected.
  * `--no-url-test` - skip reachability testing for faster execution.
  * `--no-sort` - keep configs in the order retrieved without sorting.
  * `--top-n N` - keep only the best `N` configs after sorting.
  * `--tls-fragment TEXT` - only keep configs containing this TLS fragment.
  * `--include-protocols LIST` - comma-separated protocols to include (e.g. `VLESS,Reality`).
  * `--exclude-protocols LIST` - comma-separated protocols to exclude.
  * `--resume FILE` - load a previous output file before fetching new sources.
  * `--output-dir DIR` - specify where output files are stored.
  * `--test-timeout SEC` - adjust connection test timeout.

TLS fragments help obscure the real Server Name Indication (SNI) of each
connection by splitting the handshake into pieces. This makes it harder for
filtering systems to detect the destination server, especially when weak SNI
protections would otherwise expose it.

#### **Adding Your Own Sources**

If you have your own subscription links you'd like to merge, you can add them to the script:

1.  Open the `vpn_merger.py` file in a text editor.
2.  Find the `UnifiedSources` class.
3.  Add your links to the `SOURCES` list.
4.  Save the file and run the script. If you are using the GitHub Actions method, commit the change, and the workflow will use your updated list.

#### **Retesting an Existing Output**

If you already generated a subscription file, run `python vpn_retester.py <path>` to check all servers again and sort them by current latency. The script accepts raw or base64 files.

Example:

```bash
python vpn_retester.py output/vpn_subscription_raw.txt --top-n 50
```

New files will appear in the `output` directory:
- `vpn_retested_raw.txt`
- `vpn_retested_base64.txt`
- `vpn_retested_detailed.csv`
